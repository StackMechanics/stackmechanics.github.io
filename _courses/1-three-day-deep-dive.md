Modern enterprise application architecture relies on a huge array of patterns and technologies. We'll take you through the process of building resilient, production ready applications and teach you all the patterns, tools, and techniques to deliver successfully.
We'll cover topics like:

* Design Patterns for maintainable software
* Test Driven Development
* DevOps practices such as Monitoring and Instrumentation
* Continuous Deployment
* Configuration patterns
* REST API Implementation
* Microservices
* Asynchronous Messaging
* Scaling and caching
* Legacy system integration and migration

We won't just cover theory though. Working in small groups, course participants will build a microservice architecture to solve a real world business problem.
